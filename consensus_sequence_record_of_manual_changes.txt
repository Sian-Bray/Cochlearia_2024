# No multiallellic sites present
# Reassured myself that there is nothing missing from the end of this protein
# There is a clear stop codon
# while there is a DNA binding protein at the end of the gene (g7446) that could be a missing domain, blasts of the sequence give results in well studied organisms that cover almost the same sequence length.

# Need an alignment with all the studies HKT's in it:
	# Figure 2 Almeida 2013
	# Need the residue numbers and functions
	# Figure 4 in Corratgé-Faillie
	# Results of Riedelsberger

# Added all mutants from the four papers to the JalView file:
	# Almeida 2013 have text annotations
		# HFS!!! Hit 
	# Additional from Corratgé-Faillie 2010 - ignored the deletions (too large)
		# Near HFS hit, R149E reduces the velocity of K+ uptake by ~1/2, slightly modifes K+ uptake (Mutation of His-157 in the Second Pore Loop Drastically Reduces the Activity of the Synechocystis Ktr-Type Transporter), not as important as His-157
		# Near HFS hit, S282L = sas2-1 mutation "Expression in Xenopus oocytes revealed that the sas2-1 mutation did not affect the ionic selectivity of the transporter but strongly reduced the macro scopic (whole oocyte current) transport activity. ... The sas2-1 mutation strongly decreased Na+ concentration in the phloem sap. It led to Na+ overaccumulation in every aerial organ (except the stem), but to Na+ underaccumulation in roots. The sas2 plants displayed increased sensitivity to NaCl, with reduced growth and even death under moderate salinity." (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC156079/)
		# Another dead on hit P51L, tested in rice HKT2;2 (P71), mutant does nothing though
